# Bridge Autorun (WIP)

- Legacy bridge code remains in `AnswerToAutorun.js` and `AnswerToAutorunUDP.js` at the repository root.
- This directory will house the rewired Node bridge that forwards control/telemetry between the browser and the vehicle app.
- Keep running the legacy scripts for now until the new adapter lands.
